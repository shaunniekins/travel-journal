      description: "Mount Fuji is the tallest mountain in Japan, standing at 3,776 meters (12,380 feet). Mount Fuji is the single most popular tourist site in Japan, for both Japanese and foreign tourists. The origin of the mountain’s name is uncertain. It first appears as Fuji no Yama in Hitachi no kuni fudoki (713 CE), an early government record. Among the several theories about the source of the name is that it is derived from an Ainu term meaning “fire,” coupled with san, the Japanese word for “mountain.” The Chinese ideograms (kanji) now used to write Fuji connote more of a sense of good fortune or well-being. In the present day the Japanese typically refer to the mountain as Fujisan, whereas foreign visitors tend to refer to the mountain somewhat incorrectly as Mount Fujiyama, which translates to “Mount Fuji mountain” in the Japanese language. Mount Fuji, with its graceful conical form, has become famous throughout the world and is considered the sacred symbol of Japan. Among Japanese there is a sense of personal identification with the mountain, and each summer thousands of Japanese climb to the shrine on its peak. Its image has been reproduced countless times in Japanese art, perhaps no more famously than in the series of woodblock prints Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai, which were originally published between 1826 and 1833.",

    description: "Sydney Opera House, opera house located on Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), New South Wales, Australia. Its unique use of a series of gleaming white sail-shaped shells as its roof structure makes it one of the most-photographed buildings in the world. The Sydney Opera House is situated on Bennelong Point (originally called Cattle Point), a promontory on the south side of the harbour just east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It was named for Bennelong, one of two Aboriginal people (the other man was named Colebee) who served as liaisons between Australia’s first British settlers and the local population. The small building where Bennelong lived once occupied the site. In 1821 Fort Macquarie was built there (razed 1902). In 1947 the resident conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Eugene Goossens, identified the need of Australia’s leading city for a musical facility that would be a home not only to the symphony orchestra but also to opera and chamber music groups. The New South Wales government, agreeing that the city should aspire to recognition as a world cultural capital, gave official approval and in 1954 convened an advisory group, the Opera House Committee, to choose a site. Early the following year the committee recommended Bennelong Point. The Opera House is Sydney’s best-known landmark. It is a multipurpose performing arts facility whose largest venue, the 2,679-seat Concert Hall, is host to symphony concerts, choir performances, and popular music shows. Opera and dance performances, including ballet, take place in the Opera Theatre (renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre in 2012 as a tribute to the celebrated Australian operatic soprano), which seats just over 1,500. There are also three theatres of different sizes and configurations for stage plays, film screenings, and smaller musical performances. The Forecourt, on the southeastern end of the complex, is used for outdoor performances. The building also houses restaurants and a professional recording studio. In 2007 the Opera House was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.",

    description: "The Geirangerfjord is one of Norway's most visited tourist sites and has been included on the UNESCO World Heritage List, along with the Nærøyfjord, since 2005. Along the sides of this magnificent fjord, there a number of abandoned farms. The farms that are most commonly visited are Skageflå, Knivsflå and Blomberg. Skageflå can also be reached on foot from Geiranger, while the others can only be seen from the fjord. The fjord also has several impressive waterfalls. The two most notable waterfalls in the Geirangerfjord are ‘de Syv Søstre’ (the seven sisters) and ‘Friaren’ (the suitor, also called the wooer). The two waterfalls face one another across the fjord, and the suitor is said to be trying to woo the sisters opposite. Brudesløret (the bridal veil) is another waterfall on the fjord, thus named because it falls delicately over one rocky edge, and when seen backlit by the sun looks like a thin veil over the rocks.",
